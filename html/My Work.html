 <li class="list-group-item">I am a new but rapidly Progressing artist, I mainly prefer manga styling as it directly deals with linework and shading to establish an image's flow, atmosphere and look. I draw by hand, so while using digital art, I still very much practice a traditional tendency.<p>But I am very much willing to learn for any project! I have had to adapt to many new softwares, development pipelines and ways of creation many times over during my course at SAE institute Rosebank. </p> <p> So if you need or wnat a 2D artist, or even a concept artist, or maybe even comission work please contact me readily! I am always learning and gaining experience for my art skills, these two are already only from the last two months, are vast improvements over my previous work even frm months before. I am always improving, so consider me even if my art is not currently satisfactory, because I very well could have improved since. </p>  </li>

 <h2 id="Unity-H"> What I can create in unity 3D</h2>

 <div class="card-2" style="width: 30rem;">
    <ul class="list-group ">
 <li class="list-group-item">These are small solo dev projects I made during my SAE course for the direct purpose of creating mechanics that are complex. I created a grappling hook style mechanic in the simpler looking game, as well as the smoke effects and gun firing effect, as well as the enemy Ai capable of firing a projectile at the player. <p>I also created the grab mechanic and key collection systems in the other more horror focused project, with a lighting sytem that triggers based on a player entering a tigger area. I coded these projects myself. I am willing to learn and improve on the job, gaining experience is always important, especially within coding! </p> </li>
